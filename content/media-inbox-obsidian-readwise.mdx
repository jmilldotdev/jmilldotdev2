I love [Readwise](https://readwise.io). It makes collecting your highlights from everything and moving them around so effortless.

Recently, Readwise updated their integration with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to include the last highlighted date as a property we can export. This lets us build an extremely flexible media inbox in Obsidian using the [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin.

In this tutorial, we will be building a dynamic table in Obsidian that grabs our most recent, unprocessed highlights notes. It will look something like this:

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have a Readwise account set up with some highlights. You can use [my referral link](https://readwise.io/i/jonathan903) to get a free month of Readwise to start!

Additionally, make sure you have the **Obsidian Official** and **Dataview** plugins installed from the Obsidian community plugins, and make sure both are enabled.

## Configuring the Readwise plugin and export

Go into the Obsidian settings, and go to the **Readwise Official** settings. First connect the plugin to your Readwise account, then you will see the following:

Then set the base folder that you will sync your export to, then click the customize button to be taken to the web interface for the Readwise export:

I have the following settings on this page:

`Group Files In Category Folders`

On, default settings

`Use Custom File Name`

On

`File Name`

    {{ "📚" if category == "books"}}{{"📰" if category == "articles"}}{{"🐦" if category == "tweets"}}{{"🎙" if category == "podcasts"}} {{ title }}
    

`Page Title`

    # {{ "📚" if category == "books"}}{{"📰" if category == "articles"}}{{"🐦" if category == "tweets"}}{{"🎙" if category == "podcasts"}} {{ title }}
    

`Page Metadata`

    {% if image_url -%}
    ![rw-book-cover]({{image_url}})
    
    {% endif -%}
    ## Metadata
    - Author:: {% if author %}[[@ {{author}}]]{% endif %}
    - Full Title:: {{full_title}}
    - Category:: {{ "📚" if category == "books"}}{{"📰" if category == "articles"}}{{"🐦" if category == "tweets"}}{{"🎙" if category == "podcasts"}}
    {% if url -%}
    - URL:: {{url}}
    {% endif -%}
    - Synced:: [[{{last_highlighted_date|date('Y-m-d')}}]]
    
    
    

`Highlights Header`

    {% if is_new_page %}
    ## Highlights
    {% elif has_new_highlights -%}
    ## New highlights added [[{{date|date('Y-m-d')}}]]
    Synced:: [[{{date|date('Y-m-d')}}]]
    #status/integrate
    {% endif -%}
    

`Highlight`

    - {{ highlight_text }}{% if highlight_location and highlight_location_url %} ([{{highlight_location}}]({{highlight_location_url}})){% elif highlight_location %} ({{highlight_location}}){% endif %}{% if highlight_note %}
        - Note: {{ highlight_note }}{% endif %}
    

`YAML Front Matter`

    tags: media/captures/{{category}} status/integrate
    imported-to-readwise: {{date|date('Y-m-d')}}
    

**The important pieces for our inbox:**

- The *#status/integrate* tag in `YAML Frontmatter` and `Highlights Header`

You can choose whatever tag you want here, but this is a status tag we will be using on initial sync and new highlights added to indicate that we have not processed this note yet.

- *Synced::* property in `Page Metadata` and `Highlights Header`

This adds the date as a link in YYYY-MM-DD. 

(Note that this will link your Readwise export notes to the daily notes in your graph. It is significantly more difficult to accomplish the Dataview query without these links.)

### Additional notes on configuration

All properties in the `Page Metadata` are given the double colon (::) to make them properties that Dataview will recognize.

Additionally, I have chosen to add the Author as a link using the [[@ Author]] convention I use in my vault. Feel free to change this if you do something different, it will not affect the end product.

## Building the Inbox with Dataview

After the dataview export is configured, go back to the **Readwise Official** settings in Obsidian and click *Initiate Sync*. After the export is done, place the following *dataviewjs* query in a note:

    ```dataviewjs
    const mediaType = ""
    const numToShow = 5
    const mediaFolder = '"030 Media/Readwise"'
    const statusTag = '#status/integrate'
    
    const conditions = [mediaFolder, statusTag]
    const filterCondition = conditions.join(' and ')
    
    dv.table(["File Name", "Author", "Last Synced"],
    	dv.pages(filterCondition)
    	.sort(p => [].concat(p.synced).reduce((a,b) => {return a > b ? a : b;}), 'desc')
    	.slice(0, numToShow)
    	.map(p => [
    			p.file.link,
    			p.author,
    			[].concat(p.synced).reduce((a,b) => {return a > b ? a : b;})
    		]
    	)
    )
    ```

There are *4 properties* to set here:

- `mediaType` will filter on the `Category::` property in your export. Leave it blank for all Readwise media, or set it to 📰 to get only articles, for instance
- `numToShow` is the number of results that will display in your inbox table.
- `mediaFolder` is the base folder for your Readwise export, and should be the same as what you set in the plugin settings. Note that it **MUST** be surrounded with double quotes ("")
- `statusTag` is the name of the tag you want to filter on. I have it set to grab #status/integrate as our unprocessed status tag, but you can leave it blank for no tag filtering.

If all goes well you should have a table now that looks something like this:
