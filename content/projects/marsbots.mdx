**Marsbots** is an open-source framework for easily developing and managing Discord chatbots powered by large language models like GPT-3.

It was developed during [Mars College 2022](https://mars.college/) and used to power several chatbots such as the house spirits who wrote [Mulabonding](/projects/mulabonding), the [Martian Oracle](/project/martian-oracle), and others such as a Cocktail Recipe bot and Tech Support bot.
