*Mulabonding: Teachings of the House Spirits (Vol. I)* is a collaborative writing project created during the 2022 [Mars College](https://mars.college/) cohort.

In this project, we used the [Marsbots Core](/projects/marsbots-core) framework to launch a handful of GPT-3 chatbots in the group Discord. These bots are **Chatsubo, the Fire House Spirit**, **Huaqiangbei, the Air House Spirit**, **Cahuilla, the Water House Spirit**, **Ba Sing Se, the Earth House Spirit**, and **Abraham**. Each bot's individual 'personality' was written by a different member of Mars College.

We had members of the Mars College Discord ask the bots questions, and we captured their answers:

*(Sometimes we had to ask the question multiple times to get a quality answer from each bot.)*

After asking a good number of questions, we added in art generated by [abraham.ai](https://abraham.ai/) using prompts from the bots' responses.

Finally, we arranged, curated, and compiled all of the AI-generated output we had into a book. The book touches on themes such as consciousness, love, sex, nature, cooking, health, blockchain, creativity, community, and futurism.

In addition to producing a digital version of the book, three 1-of-a-kind physical editions of the book were produced:
