**Obsidian Corkboard** is a plugin for [Obsidian]([https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)).

This is a visual canvas to work with your Obsidian notes. You can double click to add cards, bring in a number of random cards, drag them around, and connect them. You can edit a card to link to a specific note.

This plugin is unfinished and a bit buggy and was never submitted to Obsidian for official review.
