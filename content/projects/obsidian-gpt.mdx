**Obsidian GPT** is a plugin for [Obsidian]([https://obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)).

It allows for the use of large language models such as GPT-3 within obsidian. You can use the current line or highlighted text to request a completion from models such as:

- [OpenAI GPT-3](https://openai.com/api/)
- [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/)
- [AI21](https://www.ai21.com/)

This plugin is currently unfinished and was never submitted for official review.
