Hello world?

I am trying to actually use my personal site this time. So I am leaving this first post on record to say that this is what I am doing. I don't really know what to write so I'm just writing.

This Fall I am in [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/) Cohort 7. Any visitors from Write of Passage, thanks for checking out my site and good luck with everything.

Anyway, I plan to use this site to write about the things that I am working on and the things that I am thinking about. Expect a mix of technical tutorials and writings about machine learning, generative art, blockchains & NFTs, language models, building datasets, knowledge management, electronic music production, and whatever other ideas I'm entertained by at the moment

I have been very bad about starting projects, finishing projects, and sharing what I'm working on. I turned 29 recently, and I have decided that this is the year I am going to build things that are good enough, and I am going to try to have them reach the people who may want them. I dragged my feet even on writing this post. But eventually I said no plan, whatever, just go in, do it, explain yourself, and it will fall into place.

If you want to learn more check out my [Start Here](https://jmill.dev/start-here) page.

Hope to see you around the net.
