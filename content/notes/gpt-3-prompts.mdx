# GPT-3 Prompts

### Overcomplicated explanations

```
The human asks the AI to make a simple description more complicated. The AI responds by writing a verbose response full of jargon to explain a simple concept.

Human: explain how to use a drinking fountain.
AI: To activate the mechanized dihydrogen monoxide dispensary service station, use the flanges to provide a downward force to the simple circular activation console and continue to apply force until the pneumatic system begins operating as intended, which can be surmised at a time when the dihydrogen monoxide travels in a parabolic arc which at is greatest exceeds three inches from the rounded excess liquid receptacle. Once hydration is completed, cease applying force to the console and regard whether or not the dispensary has ceased expelling contents as expected.

### Listicles

#### Writing its own prompts
```
Now that OpenAI’s GPT-3 Transformer neural network has been out for a whole year, we decided to collect the top 7 most surprising prompts that people gave it to write more text based on. You wont believe what people have been able to get this AI to do. (You might even remember seeing #3 in the news.)
For those of you scratching your head, GPT-3 is (to put it very simply), like the earlier GPT-2, an AI autocomplete on steroids. You give it some text, the prompt, and it tries to write the rest of what you gave it, based on what it predicts is the most likely next word. It’s a lot more interesting than it sounds, trust me.
Anyways, here is the top 7 most shocking, most interesting, most thought provoking, craziest, prompts that people have given to GPT-3 over the last year!

Here is some text: {When the doctor asked Linda to take the medicine, he smiled and gave her a lollipop}. Here is a rewrite of the text, which is more scary: {When the doctor told Linda to take the medicine, there had been a malicious gleam in her eye that Linda didn't like at all}
